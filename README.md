**Testing Controls**

- `force_open` (query): Forces market-open behavior for one run. Example: `?force_open=true`
- `simulate_time_et` (query/env): Simulate ET time for market-hours check. Example: `?simulate_time_et=2025-09-01T10:30`
- `email_dry_run` (query/env `EMAIL_DRY_RUN`): Do not send real emails; log subject/recipient and return success.
- `BYPASS_MARKET_HOURS` (env): Global bypass for local testing outside market hours.

Quick examples:
- Local main: `python main.py` (loads `.env.yaml`, bypasses market hours for local test, sends email unless `EMAIL_DRY_RUN=true`)
- HTTP test (Cloud Functions): `GET /portfolio_monitor?force_open=true&email_dry_run=true`
- HTTP test with simulated time: `GET /portfolio_monitor?simulate_time_et=2025-09-01T10:30&email_dry_run=true`
- Error tracking with detailed stack traces
- Performance metrics via execution time logging
- Cost tracking via API usage monitoring
